# Using AWS instead of on prem infra

## Context
We have to choose between using the cloud and purchasing our own servers. If we decide to use on prem servers we will have to make an upfront investment. Using the cloud, we'll pay only for what we use. It gives developers agility. They can focus on the applications without worrying about the underlying infra, Which increases the speed of the development cycle. The cloud is also very cost effective. One prem servers are underutilized when idle. In the cloud we pay only for what we use. AWS is also the largest cloud provider, and is cheaper compared to Azure. For the above reasons we decided to use AWS.
